Design of an autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV) system to detect people in distress and send the information of the people to an already established ground control station(GCS). It consists of a long range communication system to communicate with GCS and a system to perform computer vision, avoid obstacles and navigate autonomously and plan its path accordingly. Further it can be used to build a swarm of such systems to cover a wider area and effectively help more people in distress. It involves development of a fully operational drone with PID control of drone, computer vision, image processing, GPS tracking and navigation, data transfer and acquisition.
